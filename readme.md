# MapGuru 🗺️

MapGuru is an interactive map-based game that challenges users to guess the locations of various cities around the world. This project was developed as part of a Front-End Web Development assessment for the UCD Professional Academy course.

## 📚 Project Overview

The goal of MapGuru is to enhance front-end development skills while integrating interactive geolocation features. Users will be presented with a city name and must guess where it is on the map. The closer their guess is to the actual location, the higher their score.
