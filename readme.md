# MapGuru 🗺️

MapGuru is an interactive map-based game that challenges users to guess the locations of various cities around the world. This project was developed as part of a Front-End Web Development assessment for the UCD Professional Academy course.

## 📚 Project Overview

The goal of MapGuru is to enhance front-end development skills while integrating interactive geolocation features. Users will be presented with a city name and must guess where it is on the map. The closer their guess is to the actual location, the higher their score.

## SEO

I have included Meta Descriptions, title tags, Meta Keywords into my website. If this site was deployed I would also do more research into keywords, link building and citations.


## Reports
My website has gone through a few reports to check if everything is working correctly. Each page is W3C Validated, my website is accessibile and is performing well. Copies of the reports are in a folder with submissions.
