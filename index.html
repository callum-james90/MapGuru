            <h2><b>MapGuru</b></h2>
        <p>MapGuru is a fun and interactive geography game that tests how well you know the world. Each day,
             you’ll see a photo of a city and try to guess where it is by clicking on the map. After you guess,
            the game shows you the correct location and tells you how far off you were—plus your score based 
            on how close you got! You can also use the calendar to play older challenges, but future dates are
            locked to keep it fair. It's a great way to explore new places, challenge your geography skills, 
            and maybe even discover cities you've never heard of. Everything runs in your browser, and the 
            cities, photos, and map locations are loaded smoothly using JavaScript and Leaflet. Whether you're
            a traveler, a student, or just curious about the world, MapGuru offers a new city challenge every
             day—so come play and see how close you can get!
