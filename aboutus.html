            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>MapGuru is an engaging and interactive map-based geography game designed to challenge 
                users' knowledge of world cities. In each game session, players are presented with the name of a
                 city and a visual clue, such as an image, and must click on a world map to guess where that city
                  is located. The closer the guess, the higher the score, encouraging both precision and learning.
                   With a daily quiz system and a calendar feature that tracks past scores, players are motivated
                    to return each day, improve their map skills, and challenge themselves with new cities.<br>

                The project was developed as part of a Front-End Web Development assessment for the UCD 
                Professional Academy course. It showcases key skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM 
                manipulation, and API integration using Leaflet.js for the interactive map. MapGuru combines
                 fun with education, offering a dynamic way to learn geography while demonstrating the developer's
                  technical capabilities.</p><br>

            <h2>Travel</h2>        
            <p>Travel is one of the most enriching experiences in life—it opens your mind, introduces you to new
                 cultures, and helps you see the world from different perspectives. But as exciting as it is, 
                 travel also comes with challenges, and one of the most important skills is knowing where you are.
                 Whether you're navigating a new city, exploring remote landscapes, or using public transportation
                 abroad, having a good sense of geography can save time, reduce stress, and keep you safe. 
                 Understanding maps, directions, and global locations not only enhances your travel experience but
                 also boosts your confidence and independence. It allows you to appreciate the history, culture, and
                 significance of the places you visit. In today’s world, where international travel is more 
                 accessible than ever, being geographically aware helps you connect the dots between people and 
                 places. In short, knowing where you are makes travel more meaningful, memorable, and enjoyable. </p>
